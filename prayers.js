Within this system, I am asked to have injuries assessed and press charges. I have decided to move on and forgive, even when it hurts psychologically and physically. I have come so far. I found God on this path. The thought of a higher power and true judge heals me because I am also flawed. Pray that only what I can comfortably manage may be asked of me, that heaven heals my place in this world, that I may be kept safe and provided for. "

They are alive, thanking to God. \n\nLast night Russia bombed Dnipro and Zaporizhzhya again. People are out of electricity, water, and heat again. My family is 45 min of driving from Dnipro. My brother sent me a video yesterday of how they live now without water. A flash light is hanging on the wall for some light in a dark room. The plastic battle is hanging upside down to wash face and hands only. There was water, power, and heat outage for 2 days and nights again. Water is rusty and oily all the time. They have to buy water for drinking and cooking. The weather temperature is 17F today in their city. Even though they wore every warm peace of clothing they have, it's still freezing in their apartment, and they all are sick with flu. It's devastating.  I really worry about them because today was no connection to them again after the Russians' strike yesterday. Please continue praying for my family's safety, electricity, water, and heat restoration and Michael and Angela's kidneys healing and they all recover from flu (Michael, Angela, Eugene). Please also pray for my fundraiser to provide for all my family in Ukraine needs and sponsorship for them to come here on Humanitarian Parole. \n\nPrayer list: Tatyana, Michael, Angela, Eugene, Andrew, Alex-soldier, Nataya, Nikolay, peace in Ukraine, health and safety.\n\nYou and your loved ones and church are always in my prayers. Millions of blessings and good health to all of your, my dear sisters and brothers in Christ.\nTatyana."

Our loving Lord spoke to me through the Psalm 55:22 -- Cast your burden on the Lord; and He will sustain you. I have known this word for many ears, but this time it unveiled to me in a new promising way. God is great!\n\nThank you from the bottom of my heart for your prayers for my family in Ukraine. My brother called me today because they finally got electricity after 2 days and nights of black out, no heat, no water. Glory to God, they are alive! It was impossible to buy any goods because cards and ATMs did not work. Banks were closed too because of power shat down.\nLast night Russia bombed Dnipro City again destroying electrical infrastructure and houses and injuring 13 and killing 1. People are out of electricity, water, and heat again. My family is 45 min of driving from Dnipro. I really worry about them because Russians are moving troops and tanks to Zaporizhzhya. They are planning to take Dniproptrovska Oblast where my family lives. They are just 3 hours of drive from Zaporizhzhya. Please continue praying for my family's safety, electricity, water, and heat restoration and Michael and Angela's kidneys healing and Michael and Eugene can fix the roof and sunny weather for that. Please also pray for my nephew Eugene recover from the flu and find good job asap and for my fundraiser to provide for all my family in Ukraine needs and sponsorship for them to come here on Humanitarian Parole. \n\nPrayer list: Tatyana, Michael, Angela, Eugene, Andrew, Alex-soldier, Nataya, Nikolay, peace in Ukraine, health and safety.\n\nMay God bless you and your loved ones abundantly, above and beyond your highest expectations.\n\nHave a blessed week.\nTatyana."
